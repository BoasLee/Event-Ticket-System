Step 1: Download the project
Go to "https://github.com/BoasLee/Event-Ticket-System" -> code -> Download Zip

Step 2: Open project
Navigate to where you downloaded the zip folder (step 1) -> Right click -> extract all
Navigate to unzipped folder -> Event-Ticket-System-main -> Event Ticket System -> main.py then open the python file.

Step 3: Run Python Program
Scroll down to "main" function and look for "PLEASE UPDATE PARAMETER VALUES" section (right below the main definition).
Fill out the parameter values (user, password, host, port, database, table_name, file_path ('third_party_sales.csv' is included in the folder), curr_date (for my same output, I used the date date(2020, 9, 1))
Run the Python program (there should be something like "Here are the most popular tickets in the past month:..." displayed in the console).

Step 4: Verify output
Once the program is run, the output on the console should match the "Output.txt" (included in the folder) file.
